## what is `polygon`
`polygon` is a Complete Python Wrapper for [Polygon.io APIs](https://polygon.io/). It offers 
simple and elegant programmatic access over each endpoint. Functionalities include but not limited to:

- Stocks and Options data
- Forex and Crypto data
- Real time Websocket streaming (both callback and async based)
- Technical Indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)
- Market Info, News, Holidays, Schedules, Tickers, Conditions, Dividends, Splits
- Async support for REST endpoints
- Built In stream reconnection functionality (Experimental, async streamer only)
- Full builtin Pagination support (with internal merging of responses)
- **Bulk** data download functions: bulk OCHLV aggregates bars, bulk ticker details etc.
- Extensive Option Symbology supporting 6 option symbol formats 

and a lot more...

## How Do I Use `polygon`

The complete description of everything you need to know is available in the [Documentation](https://polygon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-Started.html) which has answers to 
any question you might have with example uses included wherever needed. Docs are a must-read for most people.

- For examples to get started with, see the [examples](https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/tree/main/EXAMPLES)
- For an advanced use case example code involving redis queue and postgresql database, check out 
- [MarketMakerLite/polygon](https://github.com/MarketMakerLite/polygon) 
- The lib is also officially supported by the popular TA library [pandas-ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) 
  as an underlying data source instead of the default `yfinance`. See relevant docs to know how to use
- To see an advanced use case of downloading ALL OCHLV data for ALL tickers for 20+ years and write it to a 
  timescale enabled postgresql database efficiently, see [This Script](https://github.com/MarketMakerLite/polygon/blob/main/historical_data/advanced.py) by [MML](https://github.com/MarketMakerLite).
- The [documentation](https://polygon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-Started.html) also contain TONS of sample 
  code snippets wherever necessary.

### Quick Setup Guide With Examples

Before you do anything, you'll need to have a polygon account and get your API key. 
Visit [Your Dashboard](https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys) to get yours.

Next, you'd need to install `polygon`

```shell
pip install polygon
```

**and You're good to Go!** 

Here are a few quick usage examples.

### Getting a Stock's Previous Day OCHLV

```python
import polygon

api_key = 'YOUR_KEY'

stocks_client = polygon.StocksClient(api_key)

previous_close = stocks_client.get_previous_close('AMD')

print(previous_close)
```

### An Async Example for REST endpoints - Previous Close

```python
import polygon
import asyncio

async def main():
    api_key = 'YOUR_KEY'
    
    stocks_client = polygon.StocksClient(api_key, True)
    
    previous_close = await stocks_client.get_previous_close('AMD')
    await stocks_client.close()  # Recommended to close the httpx session when it's not needed. 
    print(previous_close)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### A Streaming Example (Callback Based)

```python
import polygon
from polygon.enums import StreamCluster

def my_own_message_handler(ws, msg):
    print(f'msg received: {msg}')

def main():
    api_key = 'YOUR_KEY'

    stream_client = polygon.StreamClient(api_key, StreamCluster.STOCKS, on_message=my_own_message_handler)
    stream_client.start_stream_thread()
    stream_client.subscribe_stock_trades(['AMD', 'NVDA'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
### An Async Streaming Example

```python
import asyncio
import polygon
from polygon.enums import StreamCluster

async def stock_trades_handler(msg):   # it is possible to create one common message handler for different services.
    print(f'msg received: {msg}')
    
async def main():
    api_key = 'YOUR_KEY'
    
    stream_client = polygon.AsyncStreamClient(api_key, StreamCluster.STOCKS)
    
    await stream_client.subscribe_stock_trades(['AMD', 'NVDA'], stock_trades_handler)
    
    while 1:
        await stream_client.handle_messages()  # the lib provides auto reconnect functionality. See docs for info
if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

```
This only scratches the surface of the library.

**See the [Documentation](https://polygon.readthedocs.io/) to start using the library with its full functionalities.**

Latest development source code of the library can be found on the 
[development branch](https://github.com/pssolanki111/polygon/tree/dev)
